# The SciML Open Souce Software Ecosystem

The SciML organization is an collection of tools for solving equations and modeling systems developed in the Julia
programming language with bindings to other languages such as R and Python. The organization provides well-maintained 
tools which compose together as a coherent ecosystem. It has a coherent development principle, unified APIs over
large collections of equation solvers, pervasive differentiability and sensitivitiy analysis, and features many
of the highest performance and parallel implementations one can find.

This documentation is made to pool together the docs of the various SciML libraries
to paint the overarching picture, establish development norms, and document the
shared/common functionality.
