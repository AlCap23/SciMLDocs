# Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)

- `reltol`: Relative tolerance
- `abstol`: Absolute tolerance
- `maxiters`: The maximum number of iterations

Additionally, the extra keyword arguments are splatted to the library calls, so
see the documentation of the integrator library for all of the extra details.
These extra keyword arguments are not guaranteed to act uniformly.
