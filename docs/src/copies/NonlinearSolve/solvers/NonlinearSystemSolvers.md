# [Nonlinear System Solvers](@id nonlinearsystemsolvers)

`solve(prob::NonlinearProblem,alg;kwargs)`

Solves for ``f(u)=0`` in the problem defined by `prob` using the algorithm
`alg`. If no algorithm is given, a default algorithm will be chosen.

This page is solely focused on the methods for nonlinear systems.

## Recommended Methods

`NewtonRaphson` is a good choice for most problems. It is non-allocating on
static arrays and thus really well-optimized for small systems, while for large
systems it can make use of sparsity patterns for sparse automatic differentiation
and sparse linear solving of very large systems. That said, as a classic Newton
method, its stability region can be smaller than other methods. `NLSolveJL`'s
`:trust_region` method can be a good choice for high stability, along with
`CMINPACK`.

For a system which is very non-stiff (i.e., the condition number of the Jacobian
is small, or the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are within a few orders of magnitude),
then `NLSolveJL`'s `:anderson` can be a good choice.

## Full List of Methods

### NonlinearSolve.jl

These are the core solvers.

- `NewtonRaphson(;autodiff=true,chunk_size=12,diff_type=Val{:forward},linsolve=DEFAULT_LINSOLVE)`:
  A Newton-Raphson method with swappable nonlinear solvers and autodiff methods
  for high performance on large and sparse systems. When used on objects like
  static arrays, this method is non-allocating.

### SciMLNLSolve.jl

This is a wrapper package for importing solvers from other packages into this interface.
Note that these solvers do not come by default, and thus one needs to install
the package before using these solvers:

```julia
]add SciMLNLSolve
using SciMLNLSolve
```

- `CMINPACK()`: A wrapper for using the classic MINPACK method through [MINPACK.jl](https://github.com/sglyon/MINPACK.jl)
- `NLSolveJL()`: A wrapper for [NLsolve.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl)

```julia
NLSolveJL(;
          method=:trust_region,
          autodiff=:central,
          store_trace=false,
          extended_trace=false,
          linesearch=LineSearches.Static(),
          linsolve=(x, A, b) -> copyto!(x, A\b),
          factor = one(Float64),
          autoscale=true,
          m=10,
          beta=one(Float64),
          show_trace=false,
       )
```

Choices for methods in `NLSolveJL`:

- `:fixedpoint`: Fixed-point iteration
- `:anderson`: Anderson-accelerated fixed-point iteration
- `:newton`: Classical Newton method with an optional line search
- `:trust_region`: Trust region Newton method (the default choice)

For more information on these arguments, consult the
[NLsolve.jl documentation](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl).

### Sundials.jl

This is a wrapper package for the SUNDIALS C library, specifically the KINSOL
nonlinear solver included in that ecosystem. Note that these solvers do not come
by default, and thus one needs to install the package before using these solvers:

```julia
]add Sundials
using Sundials
```

- `KINSOL`: The KINSOL method of the SUNDIALS C library

```julia
KINSOL(;
    linear_solver = :Dense,
    jac_upper = 0,
    jac_lower = 0,
    userdata = nothing,
)
```

The choices for the linear solver are:

- `:Dense`: A dense linear solver
- `:Band`: A solver specialized for banded Jacobians. If used, you must set the
  position of the upper and lower non-zero diagonals via `jac_upper` and
  `jac_lower`.
- `:LapackDense`: A version of the dense linear solver that uses the Julia-provided
  OpenBLAS-linked LAPACK for multithreaded operations. This will be faster than
  `:Dense` on larger systems but has noticeable overhead on smaller (<100 ODE) systems.
- `:LapackBand`: A version of the banded linear solver that uses the Julia-provided
  OpenBLAS-linked LAPACK for multithreaded operations. This will be faster than
  `:Band` on larger systems but has noticeable overhead on smaller (<100 ODE) systems.
- `:Diagonal`: This method is specialized for diagonal Jacobians.
- `:GMRES`: A GMRES method. Recommended first choice Krylov method.
- `:BCG`: A biconjugate gradient method
- `:PCG`: A preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Only for symmetric
  linear systems.
- `:TFQMR`: A TFQMR method.
- `:KLU`: A sparse factorization method. Requires that the user specify a
  Jacobian. The Jacobian must be set as a sparse matrix in the `ODEProblem`
  type.
