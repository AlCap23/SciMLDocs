# [NonlinearFunctions and Jacobian Types](@id nonlinearfunctions)

The SciML ecosystem provides an extensive interface for declaring extra functions
associated with the differential equation's data. In traditional libraries there
is usually only one option: the Jacobian. However, we allow for a large array
of pre-computed functions to speed up the calculations. This is offered via the
`NonlinearFunction` types, which can be passed to the problems.
